### Standard textual queries
Text-based fields have a selection of simple matching operations. For example, you may wish to allow lookup up an author like so:
```
>>> Author.objects.filter(name__contains='Terry')
[<Author: Terry Gilliam>, <Author: Terry Jones>]
```

This is a very fragile solution as it requires the user to know an exact substring of the authorâ€™s name. A better approach could be a case-insensitive match (icontains), but this is only marginally better.
