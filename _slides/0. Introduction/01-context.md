### Features of DJANGO

The Django framework can be seen as an MVC architecture.

It consists of 
  - an object-relational mapper (ORM) that mediates between data models 
  - a system for processing HTTP requests with a web templating system ("View"), 
  - a regular-expression-based URL dispatcher ("Controller").

### Features of DJANGO (2)

Also included in the core framework are:

- a lightweight and standalone web server for development and testing
- a form serialization and validation system 
- a template system with the concept of inheritance
- a caching framework 
- support for middleware classes for incepting at various stages of request processing and carry out custom functions

### Features of DJANGO (3)

Also included in the core framework are:

- an internal dispatcher system that allows components of an application to communicate events to each other via pre-defined signals
- an internationalization system, including translations of Django's own components into a variety of languages
- a serialization system that can produce and read XML and/or JSON representations of Django model instances
- a system for extending the capabilities of the template engine
- an interface to Python's built-in unit test framework

including:

- an extensible authentication system
- the dynamic administrative interface
- tools for generating RSS and Atom syndication feeds
- a "Sites" framework that allows one Django installation to run multiple websites, each with their own content and applications
- tools for generating Google Sitemaps
- built-in mitigation for cross-site request forgery, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, password cracking and other typical web attacks, most of them turned on by default[18][19]
- a framework for creating GIS applications
